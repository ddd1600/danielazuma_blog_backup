<h1>SKILLS</h1>
</header>

<div class="section-content">
<p>
<span class="title">Summary:</span>
As a software development generalist with broad industry experience, I am probably best utilized in a senior engineer or senior architect role. I have significant experience building and launching products from the ground up, and I have had primary responsibilities across the software development spectrum, including system architecture, backend, frontend, and devops.
</p>
<p>
<span class="title">Online application development:</span>
I spent seven years as the chief architect of a startup, developing web and mobile applications using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and related technologies, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Nginx, HAProxy, SASS, jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, AngularJS, and so forth. I built and launched a number of products end-to-end and have experience with every aspect of the process, including data and application architecture, testing, deployment, security, scaling, and support.
</p>
<p>
<span class="title">Cloud platforms:</span>
I have an intimate understanding of cloud platforms, having worked professionally as both consumer and provider. As a web and mobile developer, I have extensive experience with deploying with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>. My current role involves work on Google's <a href="http://cloud.google.com/">cloud platform</a> technologies, including App Engine, Compute Engine, and the various cloud APIs and SDKs, as well as cloud-based development, build, and deployment tools.
</p>
<p>
<span class="title">Location technologies:</span>
I am one of the leaders in geospatial/location technology for the Ruby On Rails community. I authored and currently maintain <a href="http://dazuma.github.com/rgeo">RGeo</a>, the most widely used geospatial data stack for Ruby, along with its integrations with GEOS, PostGIS, GeoJSON, and other common geospatial systems. My RailsConf 2012 <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/856">presentation</a> and accompanying <a href="http://daniel-azuma.com/articles/georails">blog series</a> are considered foundational resources for geospatial technology in the Rails community.
</p>
<p>
<span class="title">Open Source:</span>
I believe strongly in the technical and economic vitality of open source. I am active in the open source development community, both as a primary developer and as a contributor to open source projects in a variety of disciplines.
